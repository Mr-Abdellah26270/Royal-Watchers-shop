## How to Run the Project

You can run this project in two ways:

### 1. Using a local server (Recommended)

If you have Python installed, you can run a simple web server from the project's root directory:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Or if you have `npx` (comes with Node.js) installed:

```bash
npx serve
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (for python) or the address shown by `npx serve`.

### 2. Opening the HTML file directly

You can also open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
